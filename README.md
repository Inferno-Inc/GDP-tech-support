## About The Project
Purpose of this bot is to respond to questions and errors with a database packed of premade questions/answers, usage will go something like this:

![Screen Shot](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/919483376937881600/934362829132283904/unknown.png)

About the [question] part, you can input anything in there, and bot will using some fancy math and calculations based on keywords, determine what's the best answer for that question or say it didn't found anything and if you can rephrase it.

Now at start I did try to use some AI to check each message in Golem Network discord server and see if the message was a question and answer it, but it the accuracy wasn't good and @Phillip didn't want spam or annoyance in the server ðŸ™‚

Another thing you may realized, because everyone can use the command, I will try to make it easier for a new user to answer their own questions, because they can use !answer [question], making them able to format the questions adjusted for bot, not the community.  
**so its like a google search, but database filled with only golem answers, quite interesting.**
